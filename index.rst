   A concise  set of performance metrics that are tracked by the team and reported to operations management

Non Science Performannce Metrics
================================ 

The Data facility and campaign tem should report on several metrics for procesing runs to allow us to asses the state of the facility and processing. 

There may be some trade off between science and non science metrics. 
Science metrics are covered in :cite:`RTN-038`

The processing metrics include:
  - job completion time
  - processing job thorughput (jobs per min/hour)
  - memory usage
  - number of nodes used 
  - number of course used 
  - number of visits that are successfully processed vs number that are taken (what does failed processing mean)
  - number of coadd-quality images that are taken (many image will not go into a coadd due to quality) 



The Science Platform metrics include:
  - Number of RSP accounts â€“ total as a function of time
  - Active RSP accounts hour/day)
